## About

A project built for a successful tech company's front end engineering assessment. This standalone React app consumes an API that emits new rental properties and dynamically displays their ever-changing prices. The properties displayed on top are constantly updated, and infinite scrolling is used to load older (static) entries, which are sorted by date, address, and price. Additionally, a simple graph of price trends over time is displayed in a modal when clicking on a property card.

### If I had more time, I would've

- Implemented some nicer transitions and mobile responsiveness
- Paid more attention to the data visualizations
- Added some flair to the infinite scrolling
- Came up with more elegant, less time-complex ways of dealing with the data
